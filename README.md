    - Only the submitted codebase for final judgement will be archived.
- [x] The hackathon is open for innovation on top of existing open-source codebase. However, project that forks from the existing open-source projects on the market with more than **70%** codebase similarities will be disqualified immediately. 
- [x] All project team members must verify their identity on OpenGuild Discord channel (which takes 2 minutes) following the guide [**OpenGuild - Discord Guidelines**](https://handbook.openguild.wtf/general-information/guidelines/discord-guidelines)

## **Project Description**  
### What does your project do?  
ZeKae Protocol is a protocol that allows users to mint yield bearing stablecoins leaveraging Liquid Staking Tokens (LST).

### Inspiration  
I want to empower Liquid Staking Tokens like those provided by Bifrost to be used as collateral for stablecoins.

## **Technical Stack**  
- **Languages and Frameworks:**  
    - Next.js
    - Tailwind CSS
    - Lucide icons
    - ShadCN UI
    - RainbowKit
    - Wagmi
    - Viem
    - Jotai
    - Tanstack React Query
    - Vaul
    - Zod
    - React Hook Form
    - Solidity (Foundry)
- **Blockchain/Protocol:**  
    - Asset Hub (temporarily on Moonbeam until Asset Hub is ready)
- **Tools and APIs:** 
    - None

## **Features**  
- **Feature 1:** Deposit and withdraw LST from Vault used as collateral for stablecoins
- **Feature 2:** Mint stablecoins using LST as collateral
- **Feature 3:** Liquidate LST from Vault when collateral ratio is below threshold
- **Feature 4:** An oracle for the price of the underlying asset and exchange rate

## **How It Works**  
### Architecture
